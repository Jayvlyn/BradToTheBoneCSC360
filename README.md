______________________________________________________
Are you a Brad enough dude to play this game? >:)

Ruin a kid's day, it's the best! Make a mess of their favorite beach and make them cry!

Kick around everything they love, their puny sandcastle is no match for Brad.

Play as Brad, a belligerent bully who loves ruining everyone's day at the beach. Get faster and rack up points by keeping your heat high, but no too high :0

Watch out for urchins and spikes, they might save someone's day from being ruined. And Brad wouldn't want that, would he?

So go make Brad's day and ruin everyone else's in Brad to the Bone.
